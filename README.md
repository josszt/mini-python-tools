# Mini Python Tools Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the basic Python programming skills I have learned, relating to modular code structure, and reusable functions. Adding new queries to each section as they are thought of

It includes:
- Temperature conversions (Celsius <> Farenheit)
- Distance conversions (Kilometers <> Miles)
- Volume conversions (Litres <> Gallons)
- Finance tools (adding tax to a bill, adding a tip, splitting a bill and calculating monthly payments)
- Text utilities (uppercase transformation, writing script in reverse, and counting words in a sentence)

## Structure
- `conversions/` -> conversion-related functions
- `finance_tools/` -> finance-related functions
- `text_tools/` -> text-related functions
- `main.py` -> menu system using all modules

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `mini_projects` folder
3. Run `python main.py` in your terminal

## Skills demonstrated
- Python fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- Modularization / multi-file project structure
- Git/GitHub version control
